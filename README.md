We first thought of doing this as our final project, but with permission for the instructor we ended up doing it as extra credit and chesstronic (https://eberg857.github.io/Chesstronic/, https://youtu.be/dcaVRzoHaNs) became our final project instead.

Our bike system's purpose is to display different colors depending on how fast the user is riding, and upon stopping, displays a unique animation.
