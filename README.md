We first thought of doing this as our final project, but with permission for the instructor we ended up doing it as extra credit and chesstronic (https://eberg857.github.io/Chesstronic/, https://youtu.be/dcaVRzoHaNs) became our final project instead.

Our bike system's purpose is to display different colors depending on how fast the user is riding, and upon stopping, displays a unique animation. 
Check out our video of the result: https://youtu.be/eMoFD-dRQzU.

This project required two meter-long APA102-C RGB LED strips, an MSP430 microcontroller, and several battery units (as well as a working bicycle, of course).

Also make sure to check out the code we used to make this happen :)
